Text: Winter: it’s the reason many runners call it quits and retire to the dreadmill between November and April. It doesn’t have to be this way! Imagine a world where you can check the temperature, gear-up, and enjoy running just as much as you do when the grass is greener.

As a year-round run group, R4AP has logged many miles in the single digits. Here are a few recommendations to keep you warm.

Protecting the extremities (ears, fingers, toes) is your greatest asset. This allows your body to put more effort into keeping your core warm.

Another huge factor is the **wind** and its unique ability to render all your clothing attempts useless. Investing in windproof gloves (some include a windproof flap to further protect the fingers) can be the difference between 10mi of fun vs. 10mi of pain.

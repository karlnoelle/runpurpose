##Passionate Runners
Everyone has their own reasons for running, but the unifying layer beneath it all is Passion. We believe putting 100% into something yields the most rewarding experiences. Run with Purpose!

##Building Community
We believe in building authentic friendships with each other as we train! Running is so much more fun with friends — especially during those -10º sessions ;-)

##Coffee Addicts
We run, and then we drink coffee! It’s the perfect combination. Following each run, we meet at a local coffee shop around Uptown and hang out before starting the weekend.

##The Picture
We love smiling! Also: no run can begin without a pre-run photo. Itâ€™s tradition, if our (link: https://instagram.com/runpurpose/ text: Instagram feed popup: yes) is any indication. Oh, and by reading this youâ€™re giving R4AP permission to distribute the photo for marketing purposes ðŸ˜› thanks!

##Pace? Distance? Help!
Relax! Pace and distance are totally up to you. Some runners show up with headphones and do their own thing around the lake(s), while others stick together and do work around 3+ lakes. That group may run anywhere between 7:00 - 9:00min/mi.
